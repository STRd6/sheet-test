Sheet
=====

An exploration in what in means to be a spreadsheet.

We use [Jadelet](http://jadelet.com) to make the [Glitch editor](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/project/jadelet-base) and the [community site](http://glitch.com)

Getting Started
-----------------

- your app starts at `server.coffee`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env`
- `client.coffee` is compiled and served as /client.js
- view templates start at `templates/hello.jadelet`
- stylus files like `public/style.styl` is compiled and served directly as `public/style.css`
- Files in `public/` are served directly
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project
